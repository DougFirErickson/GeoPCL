# Core Functionality

* ground filtering, e.g., bare earth extraction
* above ground level height calculation
* classify buildings and high vegetation
* overlap of flight lines
* compare to control
* grid point cloud data
* tile point cloud data
* sort point cloud data
* clip point cloud data
* point cloud info
* compute spatial index
* thin (along with VoxelGrid, return only min/max/random point within grid)
* remove duplicate points
* create TIN (address breaklines)
* create DEM (address breaklines)
* create ISO (address breaklines)
* merge files
* split files
* compress files

# Other

* segmentation
* classification
* registration
* model generation
* shape recognition
* denoising
* streaming/out-of-core variants for large datasets
